This project built an image classifier using ResNet-50 (PyTorch) to categorize Amazon products into three classes. While achieving 91.67% training accuracy, test performance dropped to 41.67%, suggesting overfitting. Evaluation revealed poor results on Digital_Music. Solutions include more data and model optimization.
